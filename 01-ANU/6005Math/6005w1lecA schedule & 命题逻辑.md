# 命题逻辑logic
### definition of statements
- A ***statement*** is a sentence that is true or false but not both.


- ***Compound statements*** are statements built from other statements using logical connectives.

We can also use variables to represent arbitrary(武断的) statements. 
When a variable represents an arbitrary statement, it is called a ***statement variable***. We have symbols for various logical connectives 
(such as ¬ for ‘not’, ∧ for ‘and’, ∨ for ‘or’).

### vocabs
***A truth table*** records the truth value taken by a statement form for each possible combination of truth values taken by the statement variables appearing in the statement form
- ***NOT***¬
	- the **negation**
- ***OR***∨ 析取
	- the **disjunction**
- ***AND***∧合取
	- the **conjunction**
- ***XOR异或*** ⊕
	- “p or q but not both”
	- the **exclusive disjunction**
- ***IMPLIES***推 →
	- the **conditional** of q by p
	- When the hypothesis in a conditional is false, we say that the conditional is **vacuously true虚虚实实**（善意推理）
- ***IF*** 当且仅当 ↔
	- the **biconditional** of p and q
- ***Statements and statement forms***
	- Each statement is an **instance** of *one or more* **statement forms命题公式**
- ***ambiguity 歧义***
### Order of precedence among connective
When evaluating a statement form: 
- Obey **parentheses圆括号** over any **precedence先例** rule 
- Evaluate ¬ first 
- Evaluate ∧, ∨ and ⊕ second. 
	- When two or more are present, parentheses may be needed 
- Evaluate → and ↔ third. When both are present, parentheses may be needed.

### Example of Truth Table
e.g. (p ∧ q) ∨ (¬p ∧ ¬r)
Method 1: Extra columns

Method 2: **Align对齐** T/F under connectives


### Tautologies 同位语(重言式)

- A statement form that is true **regardless of** the truth values of its variables is called a tautology. 
- A statement whose form is a tautology is also called a tautology.


### Contradiction 矛盾式
A statement form that is false **regardless of** the truth values of its variables is called a contradiction. 
A statement whose form is a contradiction is also called a contradiction.

# Predicate logic 谓词逻辑
- 谓词&论域
- A ***predicate*** is a sentence containing one or more variables, with the property that, when a value from a specified domain is given to each variable, the sentence becomes a statement. 
The specified domain is the **domain论域** of the predicate.
- 量词
- ***Quantifiers*** There are two ways to turn a predicate p(x) into a statement: • specify a value for x; or • quantify x. What do we mean by “quantify” x? We mean to specify some notion of how many different x’s from the domain make the predicate true.
	- The **universal** quantifier, ∀, is read “for all” (or “for every”, “for each”, “for any” etc.). 
		- The universal statement ∀x p(x) is read aloud “for all x **(in the domain)**, p(x) is true” or “p(x) is true for all x (in the domain)”.
	- the **existential** quantifier, ∃, is read “there exists” (or “for at least one”, etc.) 
		- The existential statement ∃x p(x) is read aloud “There exists an x (in the domain) such that p(x) is true” 
	- ***The existential quantifier with uniqueness, ∃!,*** is read “there exists a unique” (or “for **exactly one**”, etc.) 
		- The existential statement ∃!x p(x) is read aloud “There exists **a** unique x (in the domain) such that p(x) is true” or “p(x) is true for **exactly one** x (in the domain)”.


### Notation
⇒ and ⇔ Let p(x) and q(x) be predicates and suppose the common domain of x is D. 
- The notation p(x) ⇒ q(x) is short for ∀x p(x) → q(x) 
- The notation p(x) ⇔ q(x) is short for ∀x p(x) ↔ q(x) 
- WARNING: It is not uncommon for mathematicians to use → and ⇒ interchangeably, as if they mean the same thing.

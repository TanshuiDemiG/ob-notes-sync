Base concepts: vectors and systems of linear equations 
Matrices 
Solving systems of linear equations 

# REVIEW

- **Training** is the process of making the system able to learn.
	- A model that explains a certain situation well may fail in another situation. 
- The training set and test set come from the same distribution (in- distribution vs. out-of-distribution) 
- Before applying a model, check the assumptions!

- Supervised
Input: Data X and **label y** 
Goal: Learn how to map X to y
Examples: Regression, classification Quick review 

- Unsupervised
Input: Data X, **no label** 
Goal: Learn underlying structure of data 
Examples: Clustering, dimensionality reduction

- given sorts to data or not
- linear only need **2** parameters


## clustering
- k-means
- EM
- ...
- which is to give demensions

## Dimensionality Reduction: Subspace Learning
- PCA
- ...
- to decrese the dimensions
	- x y z --> x y
- eg:
	- a pic: 10 * 10 pixels
	- demension: R G B
	- so its 10\*10\*3= 300 demensions
